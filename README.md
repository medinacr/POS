## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, EJS, MongoDB

The Express, EJS, and MongoDB stack was chosen for the KingPOS point of sale system to provide a fast and scalable web framework (Express), a flexible templating engine for dynamic content rendering (EJS), and a reliable database for data storage (MongoDB). This stack enables users to sign up, create tables or orders for customers, and checkout items. The system stores all the data in MongoDB, allowing for easy tracking of daily sales and access to order information.
